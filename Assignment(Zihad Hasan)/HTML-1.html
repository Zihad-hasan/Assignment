						<h1>Learn from those who’ve been there</h1>
							<p>
							
								Due to the nature of a web developer’s job, it pays to stay on top of all the latest trends and developments (no pun intended!) in the industry. An easy way to do this is to follow web development blogs. Blogs are especially helpful if you’re freelancing it, to ensure the services you offer your clients are continuously based on the latest solutions on the market.
								
								It’s also a great idea to see how other professionals dealt with similar challenges that you may face in your career. After all, what’s better than learning from others who’ve “been there and got the t-shirt”?
								Know the tools of the trade
								
								Furthermore, being a developer isn’t just about knowing how to code – it’s about knowing how to use the tools of the trade, specifically developer tools. Reading tutorials and learning about all their different features could also help you get ahead in your career.
								Grow your skillbase
								
								Lastly, web development is one of those disciplines that “where there’s a will, there’s a way” definitely rings true. It’s one of those areas where, if you’re willing to put in the work, the rest usually takes care of itself.
								
								Whether you’re an experienced developer, or a newbie, there’s always something new to learn or practice. Among the best out there is David Walsh, who works for Mozilla. David places practice above theory in order of importance. He believes that developers should never fear experimentation and always be willing to dabble in unknown areas. He’s also a stern believer in the fail-fast Agile methodology. We’ve actually included his blog in the list below!
								
								You can become more adventurous by reading up on all subject matters relating to the art of web development. And trust us when we say there’s plenty of free material on the web!
								Where do I start?
								
								The question is where to start. The sheer variety of content out there can leave one feeling perplexed and nonplussed about where to start. Is it better to read blog posts? Is it better to follow blogs that offer more tutorials? Or more freebies? Is it better to watch and learn from videos?
